    <p>The rules and goal of this game are quite simple.  Player Two Controls Bambi, the adorable Corgi who has found himself deep within a den of spiders. Bambi can be moved around with the arrow keys on your keyboard. Player One controls the ravenous arachnids which mercilessly descend upon Bambi by holding the Q, W, E, R, and Space Keys, though you can't just shoot all your spiders off at once!<span title="Or Does It?!?!"> The game ends when Bambi falls prey to the spiders!</span></p>
